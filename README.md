# DTI_prediction

Drug-target interaction (DTI) models are desgined for computationally predicting which proteins can be targeted by which drugs. Accurate DTI models are thought to facilitate drug discovery. Recently deep learning (DL) models show significant accuracy in predicting DTIs. Such deep learning (DL) models typically consist of two separate network structures that extract the features of drugs and target proteins separately. Then the extracted features are then concatenated, following which one or more fully connected layers are used to process the concatenated features and make binding predictions.
